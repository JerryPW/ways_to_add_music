Ways to add music in c++ codes

I will list the codes you need in here:
3 files to include
    ```#include<windows.h>`
    #include<Mmsystem.h>
    #pragma comment(lib,"winmm.lib")```

open the file:
    `mciSendString("open gameMusic.mp3 alias music",NULL,0,NULL);`


play and turn off the music:
    ```mciSendString("play music repeat",NULL,0,NULL);
    mciSendString("close music",NULL,0,NULL);```
