Adding background music is a common requirement when you are coding in the project
Here i will provide one ways to implement this requirement.

First, you need to include this three files:
#include<windows.h>
#include<Mmsystem.h>
#pragma comment(lib,"winmm.lib")

then, to open the music, you need to put the music under your project's catalog
use this line of code to open the file (you always need to open when you dealing with file): mciSendString("open gameMusic.mp3 alias music",NULL,0,NULL);
to play music, you can ues: mciSendString("play music repeat",NULL,0,NULL);
("repeat" means the music will play repeatedly, if you want it play only once, just delete the word)
At last, keep in mind to close the file: mciSendString("close music",NULL,0,NULL);
